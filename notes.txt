General notes to collect ideas and explore the topic.

Use the chatgpt API to take requests from something like voice attack, or at least just have them be voice commands however possible.

Can this be created for multiple platforms? I am seeing something that uses both chatgpt and other tools such as Google image search to provide the ultimate assistant experience.
For example, asking chatpgt for images is kind of useless, but bringing up a handful of relevant images upon request seems useful. In the case of something like image procurement,
it might be interesting to explore the ways different devices can change this behavior.
    Ex: VR/AR - floating images that you can grab out of the air to select / enlarge or whatever
    Phone: "float" these devices on the screen, explore options that aren't just opening up a safari window
    PC: same as above, may be a bit easier to "float" the images in this env. Just needs to be flashier than simply opening google search in default browser...
