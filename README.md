Excuse to toy around with chatGPT API

TO USE: Run the "transcribeAudio.py" script.

This calls the other script to record audio

  Now that I think about it.. I'm pretty sure that's borrowed and idk where it came from. Bad look for me, I know. Just an honest dude is all. I should rebuilt   this with an audacity pipe or something to prove my worth.
  
That recording gets transcribed via whisper api, resulting text is fed to completions api
